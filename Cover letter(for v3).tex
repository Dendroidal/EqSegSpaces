\section{Typos and instances of slight rewording}
 
The following lists the corrections of typos listed in the preliminary referee report.

\begin{itemize}
\item[3.] added missing relation $aef \leq r$ to ``The other broad relations obtained by broad transitivity are \dots''
\item[7.] added ``$\varphi$''
\item[10.] reworded to ``denote the category of $G$-objects''
\item[16.] fixed ``of a leaf'' typo
\item[17.] changed ``does not act'' to ``acts trivially''
\item[18.] Deleted ``In fact''
\item[20.] Replaced ``is an orbital $G$-subset'' with ``is a transitive $G$-subset''
\item[22.] added ``$\emptyset \neq E$''
%\item[24.] Reworded ``is cellular on'' to ``is built by attaching'' $G$-inner horn inclusions
\item[29.] replaced instances of $Y$ with $B$
\item[31.] replaced ``subsets'' with ``simplicial subsets'' in the discussion of covers (``which in our language are the simplicial subsets'')
\item[36.] reworded the definition of hypersaturated class
\item[38.] fixed $\Lambda^EF[T]$ typo
\item[45.] Changed ``Theorem 6.1'' to ``Thm. 6.1'' when citing MW09 (in the Remark discussing why strict lifting properties in $\mathsf{dSet}^G$ are unsatisfactory)
\item[47.] Added missing dot to ``Thm. 2.1'' in the citation from Per17 (at the beggining of \S 4)
\item[50.] added comment saying that ``$\square$ denotes the pushout product''
\item[51.] added $n \geq 1$ condition
\item[52.] added $m \geq 1$ condition
\item[54.] fixed ``monormorphism'' typo
\item[57.] added $n \geq 1$ condition
\item[60.] replaced ``equivalences in $\mathsf{dSet}^G$'' by ``weak equivalences in $\mathsf{dSet}^G$'' in part (ii) of the Corollary
\item[71.] added ``normal'' to ``a map $X\to Y$ in $\mathsf{PreOp}^G$ will have the right lifting property against all monomorphisms''
\item[73.] fixed $\mathsf{Preop}^G$ typo
\item[75.] fixed $x_n$ instead of $x_k$ typos
\item[79.] fixed $\varphi$ to be $\psi$
\item[82.] fixed ``automorphim'' typo
\item[83.] removed the word ``degeneracy'' in the discussion of generalized Reedy category structure on $G \times \mathbb{S}$
\item[84.] added comment saying that ``$L_r$ and $M_r$ are recalled below'' before the theorem
\end{itemize}




\section{Incorrect references}

\begin{itemize}
\item[48.] Fixed reference to ``Prop. 3.4.18'' of Hir03 to be ``Thm Prop. 3.3.18'' (I had an old version of the paper).

In addition, some extra detail concerning how \cite[Prop. 3.3.18]{Hir03} was being used was added, and some of the notation in Proposition 4.1 and its proof was adjusted to allow for this.
\item[49.] Fixed reference to ``Thm. 3.3.8'' of Hir03 to be ``Thm 3.2.13'' (I had an old version of the paper)
\end{itemize}
