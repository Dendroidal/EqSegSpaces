\section{Incorrect references}

\begin{itemize}
\item[6.] Fixed reference [BP17, Prop. 3.21] to [BP17, Prop. 3.23], and clarified the citation for BP17.
\item[48.] Fixed reference to ``Prop. 3.4.18'' of Hir03 to be ``Thm Prop. 3.3.18'' (I had an old version of the paper).

In addition, some extra detail concerning how \cite[Prop. 3.3.18]{Hir03} was being used was added, and some of the notation in Proposition 4.1 and its proof was adjusted to allow for this.

\item[49.] Fixed reference to ``Thm. 3.3.8'' of Hir03 to be ``Thm 3.2.13'' (I had an old version of the paper)

\item[85.] Modified the reference \cite[\S 4]{BM11} to \cite[\S 4,\S 6]{BM11}, to note that \S 6 is where (co)skeleta are actually discussed. 
\end{itemize}



\section{Minor corrections}

\begin{itemize}
\item[8.] Clarified the definition of ``outer face map'' and corrected ``non-identity'' to be ``non-isomorphism''.
\item[41.] added a Remark to the end of \S 2.1 comparing $\Omega$ to $\mathsf{sSet}$, and introduced the stick tree $\eta$.
\item[56.] Added adjunction equations, highlighed second definition, 
\item[78.] Corrected and clarifed equation describing the homotopy genuine operad.
\item fixed typo in the remark stating that $N[m] \to N \widetilde{[m]}$ is built from $0$-horns. Namely, ``$m$-simplex $\underline{a}$'' should have been ``$k$-simplex $\underline{a}$''
\end{itemize}

\section{Misc.}


\begin{itemize}
\item updated the reference to ``Equivariant Dendroidal Sets'' and other articles to reflect their publication

      Additionally, checked all references to the paper to make sure that they match the final version.
\item Added minor exposition in \S 5.1
\end{itemize}


\section{Departures from suggestions/direct answer to comments}

\begin{itemize}
\item[24.] clarified the class of cellular maps, and added references for nomenclature.
      % (in particular, distinguished it from the class of saturated maps)
      % Reworded ``is cellular on'' to ``is built by attaching'' $G$-inner horn inclusions
\item[25.] added a reference to Goodwillie for the use of the adjective ``convex'', and included the name ``downward closed. As our argument is similar in spirit to Goodwillie's, we kept to using his nomenclature

\item[27.] The new (Ch2) follows from the original conditions, but it requires both the original (Ch2) and (Ch3), which work in tandem. The discussion was expanded to provide more detail on this. 

As a side note, (Ch2) and (Ch3) are complementary, and if it weren't for the fact that equivariance forces us to worry about isotropies, I believe they could be combined without much worry.
However, separating (Ch3) is needed to control the isotropies (which is why (Ch3) is needed when verifying condition (c) in the proof). In fact, in earlier iterations of the characteristic edge lemma condition (Ch3) used to make explicit reference to elements $g \in G$, before the current version of (Ch0) was identified.

\item[30.] Corrected $A_C = A \cup \bigcup_{g\in G,V \in C} b_{[g]}(\Omega[gV]) = 
A \cup \bigcup_{g\in G,V \in C} g b_{[e]}(\Omega[V])$.

Similarly, added the alternate formula already in the proof of the characteristic edge lemma.

{\color{red} To do:} Explain that here $gV$ refers to the image of $V$ under the induced isomorphism 
$\mathsf{Face}(U_{[e]}) \xrightarrow{g} \mathsf{Face}(U_{[g]})$


\item[37.] I do not think the proof of Proposition HYPER PROP should require anything analogous to the mentioned condition (b) in the proof of Lemma CHAREDGE LEM. The point is that for $U \in \Omega$ and $V \hookrightarrow$ a planar face, it is $|V|<|U|$ unless $V=U$. We've added an extra sentence to Remark FACCES REM that should make this point clearer.

\item[39.] The given argument for the Segal hypersaturation indeed used $T \in \Omega^G$. Since this made the discussion somewhat awkward, we've moved the argument being made to (the  new) Proposition SCANOD PROP, and rephrased accordingly.



\item[40.] this is a matter of taste, but I find changing $T$ to $S$ in $\Lambda^E_o[T] \to \Omega[T]$ to contrast with $Sc[T] \to \Omega[T]$ to be a bit confusing. To emphasize that both of the $T$ variables are free, rather than chosen, I've instead added ``$T\in \Omega_G$'' to both expressions.

\item[53.] The adjunctions from this notation are barely used in this part of the exposition. At most, part (i) of Proposition SSSETJREE PROP uses a single instance, which is also simpler since only the single $\partial \Delta[m]$ isn't a representable. It feels somewhat unnecessary to fully expand on the adjunctions at this point in the discussion. 

% not used in this part of the exposition, and in general the statements are cleaner and clearer when the two directions have different source categories.

% This is not quite true! The adjunction is necessary when proving part (i) of Proposition SSSETJREE PROP!

\item[65.] As written, Corollary REGGENHORN COR was indeed needed to finish the argument in Corollary JOINTFIBCHAR COR. This has been addressed by adding the generating horn inclusions $\Lambda^{Ge}[T] \to \Omega[T]$ to Proposition HYPER PROP.


\end{itemize}



\section{Important stuff I'm not sure how to qualify}


\begin{itemize}
\item[9.] Rephrased the language in the ``$U^{\cup}$ and $U^{\cap}$'' proof to explain why the argument isn't circular. The main point being that ``edge'' and ``vertex'' are simply suggestive names for ``element'' and ``generating relation'' of the broad poset.


\item[11.] Converted the previous ``factorization of orbital faces'' remark to a proposition and proved it.

Edited Proposition UNIQUEFACT PROP to also include a statement about planar maps.

Expanded the notation defining ``outer closure'' to clarify both its meaning and why such an outer face exists.


\item[12.] Reworded the proposition to state that $GU$ is the smallest orbital face containing $U$.

Changed the language in the proof to reflect the restatement and provide some extra detail.


\item[13.] The ``$\leq_d$-incomparability of components'' language was removed in favor of a better explanation for the remark in point 15 below (which was moved to before this result)


\item[14.] Reworded the ending of the $GU$ proof to clarify the argument and be consistent with the rewording of the proposition itself.

\item[15.] The remark concerning when $G\cdot_H U \to T$ is injective was moved to an earlier point, and a clearer explanation was provided.

\item[21.] Provided references for the characterization of $G$-normal monomorphisms.
 

\item[26.] Added a new paragraph explaining why conditions (a)(b)(c) imply that the given square is a pushout.


\item[42.] Clarified the meaning of hypersaturation when not assuming that the maps are cofibrations.

\item[43.] Clarified that the ``single colored $G$-operad'' is on the category of sets.

\item[44.] added comment that $\Omega(T)$ is the operad generated by $T$ and added references.

In addition, included the $\Omega(T)$ notation and references near the beginning of \S 2.1 when the similarity between the broad poset and the operad generated by $T$ is mentioned.

\item[55.] Fixed the math typo in the proof where $G$ should have been $\Lambda^i[n] \times G$.

In addition, a large portion of this proof has been rewritten with some slight changes in notation and more details provided.

\item[56.] Added a new remark discussing the two-variable adjunction and associated lifting properties.

\item[62.] The confusing wording has been changed (the reason for the wording was the fact that I was trying to point out that the condition in the (new) HYPERMODEL REM had to be checked).

\item[63.] Edited proof to explain why the given condition shows $X_L,X_k $ are fibrant.

\item[64.] Edited the proof to explain why the maps $\Omega[T] \otimes (\{i\} \to J)$ suffice.

\item[66.] Edited the Notation defining $J^m$ to provide a little more information.

Added a new remark immediately after said notation proving that $J^{\bullet}$ is Reedy cofibrant cosimplicial.

Added reference to this new remark in the discussion in Remark CONCRECOM REM.

Added reference to this new remark in the proof of Proposition COMPLE PROP.

Added a definition of the bisimplicial $X(-)$ notation immediately before Proposition SESP PROP.

Edited Proposition SESP PROP and its proof to replace appearances of $n$ with $m$.

\item[67.] added Remark after the proof of the model structure on $\mathsf{PreOp}^G$, defining equivariant Segal operads as fibrant objects

\item[69.] Reworded the proof describing the normal generators of $\mathsf{PreOp}^G$ to avoid the confusing wording.

\item[70.] Completed the proof describing the normal generators of $\mathsf{PreOp}^G$ by indicating why the generators are normal.

\item[72.] added explanation for why $X \otimes J$ is a cylinder object.

\item[74.] Added Proposition to beginning of \S 5.1 characterizing equivariant dendroidal Segal spaces in the vein of [CM13a, Cor. 5.6]

\item[81.] added an explanation for why $X^h(J) = X(J)$.
